- "File" is way too weak a word for what it is doing.

- "++" and "#" are not valid characters of an identifier for class and
  method names (but you knew that :) )

- "Java", and names like it, are much too vague

- Interesting idea to have both the source code and the graphs to be
  derived from the same class.  That might work, and it might not.

- "Result" is too weak a name, so is Report.  However, the structure
  looks good.
