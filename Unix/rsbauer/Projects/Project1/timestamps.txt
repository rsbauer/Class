File Time Modification

The following list shows two columns - the one on the left is the file times
and which ones were modified, the right column the command being tested.

The file left column indicators are as follows (as seen in the unix command
stat):
A - Access time
M - Modify time
C - Change time

The results:

A-- cat
A-- more
A-- less
A-- head
A-- wc
