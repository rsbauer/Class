This feature was to determine if it would be feasible to add the read/save functionality
as a plugin.

The QtPlugin directory was an attempt to get a Qt demo working.  I instead opted for EchoWindow
which was a bit easier to work with.  The EchoWindow project is from Qt without modification.

The SavePlugin is a copy of the EchoWindow project with modifications to attempt to save
the model (as seen in feature 1).  I did not have any luck persuading the plugin to retrieve
the model for saving.
