This feature was to implement a method for reading and saving files.

The attempt was to use Qt's QXmlSerializer class.  I ended up using a serializer 
design pattern found here: http://dirkriehle.com/computer-science/research/1996/plop-1996-serializer.pdf

I ended up writing this feature from scratch, using the serializer design pattern as a model.

I used the model class to similute a very simple class (possibly a diagram class).  The goal
was to serialize this class and save it to disk and retrieve it later.  

I implemented a tab delimited reader/writer and an xml reader/writer.  The xml reader uses
Qt's XmlSimpleReader to parse the xml.
