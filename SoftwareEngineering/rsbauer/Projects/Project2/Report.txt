Project 2 Thoughts and Observations

I'll admit we pushed this one a bit to try to get it done in the time we had 
available.  It also didn't help I should have held on to the planning poker 
cards (oops- my bad).  I tried to plan ahead as much as possible and printed all 
of the tasks out (1 task per sheet).  Then we could lay out the tasks and go 
over each one-by-one, coming up with an estimate and then noting the estimate on 
the paper.  This worked.  I was pushing to get through the 25 tasks so I tried 
to keep things moving.  If I was to do it again, I think setting aside a bit 
more time and having the planning cards available would have helped.  Pat and 
Anthony were pretty quiet during this exercise.  I tried to engage them with a 
"what do you think? or what estimate would you give?" and would get a shrug or a 
"I guess so" in return.  

The task estimates, I think, are way too conservative.  I mentioned that based 
on the estimates, we would have a complete app done in less than 6 weeks (in 
theory, with 6 developers).  I asked them to do a gut check and the result was, 
"yeah, maybe that is a little tight - let's double the estimates."  We ended up 
leaving the estimates as is, since they felt they could code this up pretty 
quick.  

I used the white board to map the tasks to iterations and had the team call out 
the task and the estimate to place in the associated iterations.  Then we came 
up with our two events for the two iterations and readjusted the task placement. 
 I took photos to capture the white board notes.  The team then updated the tasks 
with the estimates we came up with and I updated our project page.
