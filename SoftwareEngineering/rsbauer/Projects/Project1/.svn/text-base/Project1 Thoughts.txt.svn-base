Project 1 Thoughts and Observations

Our team met in person towards the beginning of the project to zero in on what 
the app was to do.  It gave us a chance to bounce ideas around and I think this
worked out nicely.  We came up with all of our user stories during this time.  
I attempted to play the customer.  I was switching back and forth between 
customer and developer.  I'm not sure how well that had worked out.  The team 
came up with stories and I was putting them up on the whiteboard.  This allowed
the team to see what we covered and come up with new ideas.  Once we settled on
the user stories, we did the planning poker session.  This worked out nicely.  
We had some disagreement, but peer pressure took over and people came in line 
pretty quick (I was hoping for maybe a bit more discussion).  We set our 
priorities on the stories and called it a day.  From then on, we used the wiki 
and Trac to submit our work and the email list to communicate.
