<div>-     Food/beverage delivery service (on or off campus)</div>
<div>-     Event registration (reserve room and/or resources, allow users to register and pay)</div>
<div>-     Open parking space locator - pay for parking and/or pay meter via cell phone.  Maybe provide route guidance - if you need to be at building X, rate parking spots by walk time to that building.</div>
<div>-     Clicker replacement - I forgot the name of the gadget and I'm not sure if any profs at U. Akron still use it.  It was a gadget used in class to register student's responses during a lecture (it had a keypad and yes/no, I think).  So the prof shows a question and provides multiple-guess answers and the students what bunch in their best answer.  The prof can review the responses and see if the students grasped the material or not. </div>
